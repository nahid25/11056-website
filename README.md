# 11056-website
Here is a detailed reflection of my project 1. This project is about demonstrating the artistic culture that is Canberra. Thus, in order to show the essence of this culture I’ve created a website. And in this report, I will be describing the process and design method I’ve used to achieve and showcase these artworks. 

**Website Theme.**
The website theme and the colour is very important for a website. When it’s done right it can get the job done for the organisation, company or individual. Considering that it became very important to inspect this matter to attract the correct audience for our website. As it happens to be an art website, that usually attracts the attention of mature adults and art students and art enthusiasts. So we’ve decided to pick a clean and simplistic look thus, appearing desirable to both mature adults and those that are young art students. 

**Welcome Page.**
For a website, the welcome page is very crucial as it will be the first thing the user will be interacting with. This welcome page needs to show the necessary information and convey the message about the site. In the sketch below I show three different versions of the welcome page. It all includes a full-screen background with some margin on the side. Logo on the top corner of the page. Title and the subtitle of the page. My final design is based on all these three concepts. With a welcome background title in the middle and subtitle. With parallax scrolling to engage the audience with the website.

**Website Navigation**

Here are my sketches for navigating the website. I’ve chosen the second concept without any border highlighting the navigation menu. The second navigation doesn’t have any border thus, giving us a very clean and modern navigation menu for the audience. The navigation includes the festival page, news page with a drop-down of covid-19 information, about us drop-down people page, and city commission dropdown with all the other projects. 

However, upon further investigation, I felt the website only needed to add the following sites on the navigation. Festivals including all the years inside the main page, news including provide-19 and removing covid-19 from the navigation. About us removing people from navigation and merging them into one page. City commissions removing all the drop-down menus. And including all the information on the same page.
