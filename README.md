# 11056-website
Here is a detailed reflection of my project 1. This project is about demonstrating the artistic culture that is Canberra. Thus, in order to show the essence of this culture I’ve created a website. And in this report, I will be describing the process and design method I’ve used to achieve and showcase these artworks. 

**Website Theme.**
The website theme and the colour is very important for a website. When it’s done right it can get the job done for the organisation, company or individual. Considering that it became very important to inspect this matter to attract the correct audience for our website. As it happens to be an art website, that usually attracts the attention of mature adults and art students and art enthusiasts. So we’ve decided to pick a clean and simplistic look thus, appearing desirable to both mature adults and those that are young art students. 

**Welcome Page.**
For a website welcome page is very crucial as it will be the first thing the user will be interacting with. In this welcome page it needs to show the necessary information and convey the message about the site. In the sketch below I show three different version of the welcome page. All includes a full screen background with some margin on the side. Logo on the top corner of the page. Title and the sub title of the page. My final design is based all this three concept. With an welcome background title in the middle and sub title. With parallax scrolling to engage the audience with the website.
