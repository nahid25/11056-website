Reflection on Project 1: Capturing Canberra's Artistic Culture through Web Design
In this detailed reflection, I discuss my project focused on showcasing Canberra's artistic culture through a website. This report outlines the design process and methodologies employed to effectively present these artworks.

**Website Theme**
Selecting an appropriate theme and color palette is crucial for a website's success. For our art-focused site, aimed at mature adults, art students, and enthusiasts, we chose a clean, simple aesthetic to appeal to our target audience.

**Welcome Page.**
The welcome page, being the first point of interaction for users, is vital. It should present essential information and convey the site's purpose. My final design, inspired by three different concepts, features a full-screen background, a prominent logo, and clear titles and subtitles. Parallax scrolling was incorporated to engage visitors.

**Website Navigation**

The navigation design is key to user experience. I opted for a clean, borderless menu for a modern feel, including pages for festivals, news with COVID-19 updates, and about us. After further consideration, I streamlined the navigation by consolidating related pages and removing unnecessary drop-down menus.

**Website sitemap**

The sitemap is an integral part of website design, guiding user interaction even though it remains unseen. Key modifications included merging the News and COVID-19 pages to reduce user frustration, consolidating the Festivals page for easier access to artworks, creating a dedicated Donate page for better visibility, and combining About Us and People pages for convenience. Here is a sitemap showing all the ways pages will be connected. 

Site map 01 - News and Covid-19 page will be merged, it is done so the user doesn’t get frustrated by going to many links. Yet, able to get the necessary information from the same page.

Site map 02- Festivals page includes all the artwork of every year on one page. To minimise a lot of travelling between pages. 

Site map 03 - Donate page is allocated by itself to get a lot of attention to the donation. Because the audience donation makes this art possible. Thus, I’ve provided the donation with its page.

Site map 04- About us and people page conveys a lot of relatable information thus, they’ve been merged for convinces.

Site map 05 - This site map demonstrates all the projects they are working on. Undercity commissions links and on the page it redirects other artists like Alison Adler.

**Website Footer.**

In line with our theme, the footer was designed to be simple and modern, featuring social media links and copyright information.

**Body.**

Upon scrolling past the welcome background, users find centrally aligned information about the page, including festival artworks, sponsor details, and commission projects. This section uses a zig-zag pattern of images and text to showcase artwork from the past three years, alongside interactive elements like 'read more' buttons.

**Body festival artwork.**

This section of the main page is supposed to show all the artwork from 3 years. Side by side so the user can go to those years and explore the artwork. It includes an image and a read more button. However, I've gone with a jig jag pattern of image and text. With a read more button.

**Sponsor artwork.**

It includes artwork with big background and parallax scrolling. With title and sponsor image and information and read more button.

**Commissions Project.**

At the bottom of the home page. I’ve included the commissions and ongoing projects. This section includes two images on one side, occupying the space and size. With helpful information about the project including header and more information. 

**About us, Team**
The About Us page features team member images with accompanying information. This layout, welcoming users with essential details before introducing the team, reflects the site's overall design philosophy.

At the end of the page, we’ve added contact form for the user to get in touch with the us.

**Skeleton Structure of About us, Team, Donate**

The sketch above is used to show a pattern. I’ve applied this pattern to various pages. Such donate, contact and team. The reason to use a structure like this is as follows; it keeps the user's attention without getting distracted. The website has consistency. Also, this works with our modern and clean theme. Which is very important to showcase the artwork. 

Here is how the following pattern has been applied to the website. In the beginning, it welcomes the user with a title and a subtitle. Then a brief description of the page. It is nice and neatly centred in the middle. With the same consistent font and colours.
Then body focuses on the main information regarding the site. It is also centred and used bold text and title text. As needed to gain the attention of the user while delivering the important information as fast as possible. Also included visual representation as images. And form for the users to complete. 

At end of our page, it included a clean and modern footer. Sharing the link to social media.

**Conclusion**
The project culminates with a footer that ties together the website's design elements and provides social media links for further engagement. This cohesive design approach ensures the artwork is showcased effectively while maintaining a user-friendly experience.
