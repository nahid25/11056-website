# 11056-website
Here is a detailed reflection of my project 1. This project is about demonstrating the artistic culture that is Canberra. Thus, in order to show the essence of this culture I’ve created a website. And in this report, I will be describing the process and design method I’ve used to achieve and showcase these artworks. 

**Website Theme.**
The website theme and the colour is very important for a website. When it’s done right it can get the job done for the organisation, company or individual. Considering that it became very important to inspect this matter to attract the correct audience for our website. As it happens to be an art website, that usually attracts the attention of mature adults and art students and art enthusiasts. So we’ve decided to pick a clean and simplistic look thus, appearing desirable to both mature adults and those that are young art students. 

**Welcome Page.**
For a website, the welcome page is very crucial as it will be the first thing the user will be interacting with. This welcome page needs to show the necessary information and convey the message about the site. In the sketch below I show three different versions of the welcome page. It all includes a full-screen background with some margin on the side. Logo on the top corner of the page. Title and the subtitle of the page. My final design is based on all these three concepts. With a welcome background title in the middle and subtitle. With parallax scrolling to engage the audience with the website.

**Website Navigation**

Here are my sketches for navigating the website. I’ve chosen the second concept without any border highlighting the navigation menu. The second navigation doesn’t have any border thus, giving us a very clean and modern navigation menu for the audience. The navigation includes the festival page, news page with a drop-down of covid-19 information, about us drop-down people page, and city commission dropdown with all the other projects. 

However, upon further investigation, I felt the website only needed to add the following sites on the navigation. Festivals including all the years inside the main page, news including provide-19 and removing covid-19 from the navigation. About us removing people from navigation and merging them into one page. City commissions removing all the drop-down menus. And including all the information on the same page.

**Website sitemap**

Here is a sitemap showing all the ways pages will be connected. This is a very important concept. When we can do this part correctly we can get the most attention from the audience. Tho, this information is hidden from the user it is very important. I will demonstrate the site map of this website. 

Site map 01 - News and Covid-19 page will be merged, it is done so the user doesn’t get frustrated by going to many links. Yet, able to get the necessary information from the same page.

Site map 02- Festivals page includes all the artwork of every year on one page. To minimise a lot of travelling between pages. 

Site map 03 - Donate page is allocated by itself to get a lot of attention to the donation. Because the audience donation makes this art possible. Thus, I’ve provided the donation with its page.

Site map 04- About us and people page conveys a lot of relatable information thus, they’ve been merged for convinces.

Site map 05 - This site map demonstrates all the projects they are working on. Undercity commissions links and on the page it redirects other artists like Alison Adler.

**Website Footer.**

In order to comply with the theme of this page. I’ve chosen very simple and modern footer. The footer includes all the social media links and a copyright information about a made up company.

**Body.**

Once the user scrolls welcome background. They will be met with the information about the page. On our home page, this information is centred and aligned with a title. 

**Body festival artwork.**

This section of the main page is supposed to show all the artwork from 3 years. Side by side so the user can go to those years and explore the artwork. It includes an image and a read more button. However, I've gone with a jig jag pattern of image and text. With a read more button.

**Sponsor artwork.**

It includes artwork with big background and parallax scrolling. With title and sponsor image and information and read more button.

**Commissions Project.**

At the bottom of the home page. I’ve included the commissions and ongoing projects. This section includes two images on one side, occupying the space and size. With helpful information about the project including header and more information.
